# Overview


This report has been created with the objective of identifying which physical or chemical properties of crude oil could be responsible for pipeline incidents. Using data collected by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), this report will first seek to establish the existence of a relationship between crude oil and certain modes of pipeline failure. If this can accomplished, the report will then attempt to determine which physical and/or chemical characteristics of crude oil are resulting in a higher incidence rate of said failure in pipelines carrying crude oil versus other commodities. 

## Background 

The primary dataset used in this report contains a summary of pipeline accidents recorded in the United States spanning from January 2010 to Present Day. Before any kind of analysis can be performed, the limitations of this data, and the circumstances under which it was collected must first be understood. The data sourced from the PHMSA specifically details the incidents reported on Hazardous Liquid or CO2 pipeline systems, this is a broader categorization for pipeline systems carrying any of the following commodities. 

1) Biofuel/Alternative Fuel (Including Ethanol Blends)
2) CO2
3) Crude Oil
4) HVL
5) Refined/Petroluem Products

Although this report will focus specifically on the realationship between crude oil and pipeline accidents, the dataset contains records for other commodities. Also worth noting is that not all pipeline incidents are considered reportable. The PHMSA only requires an operator to report a pipeline incident in the event that any of the following occur. 

1) Fatality or injury requiring hospitalization.
2) Estimated property damage, including cost of clean-up and recovery, value of lost product, and damage to the property of the operator or others, or        both, exceeding $50,000.
3) Highly volatile liquid releases of 5 barrels or more or other liquid releases of 50 barrels or more.
4) Liquid releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion.

Finally, before attempting to analyze what attributes of crude oil contribute to pipeline failure, it must first be understood how PHMSA categorizes cause failure in their data collection process. Broadly speaking, the PHMSA recognizes six distinct causes of pipeline failure.

1) Corrosion 
2) Excavation Damage
3) Incorrect Operation
4) Material/Weld/Equipment Failure
5) Natural Force Damage
6) Other Outside Force

For the purposes of this report, it should be noted that some of these categories won't be seen as relevant to the analysis. For instance, the category 'Other Outside Force' which refers to pipeline accidents caused by any non-natural external force (e.g. vandalism, vehicle accident) would not be relevant in this analysis because the frequency of these events is unrelated to the physical or chemical properties of the pipelines contents. 

In fact, of these six categories, the only one that can be viewed as directly related to the physical contents of the pipeline itself, is Corrosion. Excavation Damage refers to incidents in which pipelines are inadvertently damaged by excavating equiment. Incorrect Operation is the result of operator error, and Natural Force Damage arises from naturally occuring external forces, such earthquakes or hurricanes. Finally, Material/Weld/Equipment failures result from improper maintenance or component selection, or flaws in the construction of the pipeline and supporting apparatus. Since the focus of this report is specifically on the relationship between the physical and chemical properties of crude oil and pipeline failure, the analysis will focus exclusively on Corrosion failures.
