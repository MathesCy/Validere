# Overview


This report has been created with the objective of identifying which physical or chemical properties of crude oil could be responsible for pipeline incidents. Using data collected by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), this report will first seek to establish the existence of a relationship between crude oil and certain modes of pipeline failure. If this can accomplished, the report will then attempt to determine which physical and/or chemical characteristics of crude oil are resulting in a higher incidence rate of said failure in pipelines carrying crude oil versus other commodities. 

## Background 

The primary dataset used in this report contains a summary of pipeline accidents recorded in the United States spanning from January 2010 to Present Day. Before any kind of analysis can be performed, the limitations of this data, and the circumstances under which it was collected must first be understood. The data sourced from the PHMSA specifically details the incidents reported on Hazardous Liquid or CO2 pipeline systems, this is a broader categorization for pipeline systems carrying any of the following commodities. 

1) Biofuel/Alternative Fuel (Including Ethanol Blends)
2) CO2
3) Crude Oil
4) HVL
5) Refined/Petroluem Products
