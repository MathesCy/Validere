# Overview


This report has been created with the objective of identifying which physical or chemical properties of crude oil could be responsible for pipeline incidents. Using data collected by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), this report will first seek to establish the existence of a relationship between crude oil and certain modes of pipeline failure. If this can accomplished, the report will then attempt to determine which physical and/or chemical characteristics of crude oil are contributing to said failure. 

## Background
